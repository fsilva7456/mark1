## Schema Status

âœ… All database tables are now correctly configured according to the application requirements. The following updates were applied:

1. **calendars Table**:
   - Added missing fields: `name`, `posts`, `status`, `posts_scheduled`, `posts_published`, `progress`, and `modified_at`

2. **calendar_posts Table**:
   - Completely recreated with all required fields including `calendar_id`, `title`, `content`, `post_type`, etc.

These schema updates ensure that the application code works correctly with the database structure.

## Application Workflow

The Mark1 app follows these key process flows for generating marketing strategies, content outlines, and content calendars:

### 1. Marketing Strategy Generation Process

The marketing strategy generation process creates a structured strategy matrix based on user input:

1. **User Questionnaire**:
   - User answers a series of questions about their fitness business
   - Questions cover business type, target audience, marketing objectives, unique approach, content preferences, and competitors

2. **AI Processing**:
   - User responses are collected and organized
   - Business description is extracted from responses
   - Data is sent to the Gemini AI model with a structured prompt

3. **Matrix Generation**:
   - AI generates a 3x3 strategy matrix containing:
     - 3 target audience segments
     - 3 business objectives (one per audience segment)
     - 3 key messages (one per audience-objective pair)
   - AI response is parsed to extract the JSON array

4. **Strategy Review and Customization**:
   - User can review the generated strategy matrix
   - User can edit any element of the matrix to customize it
   - AI suggestions are provided to help with customization

5. **Strategy Storage**:
   - When user saves the strategy, it's stored in the `strategies` table
   - Each element of the matrix (audience, objectives, key messages) is stored in a separate JSONB array
   - Strategy is linked to the user account via `user_id`

6. **Next Steps**:
   - User can generate a content outline based on the saved strategy
   - Strategy ID is passed to the content outline generation process

### 2. Content Outline Generation Process

The content outline process creates a structured 3-week content plan based on the marketing strategy:

1. **Strategy Retrieval**:
   - Content outline page loads the strategy ID from URL parameters or localStorage
   - Strategy data is fetched from the `strategies` table
   - The data includes business description, target audience, objectives, and key messages

2. **Multi-Stage Generation**:
   - The generation process uses a multi-stage approach for better results:
   
   a. **Weekly Themes Generation**:
      - Initial API call to `/api/content/multi-stage/generate-themes`
      - AI model creates 3 weekly themes based on strategy
      - Each theme includes a title, objective, target audience segment, and campaign phase
      - Has built-in retry logic (up to 3 attempts) with exponential backoff
   
   b. **Week-by-Week Content Generation**:
      - For each weekly theme, makes a separate API call to `/api/content/multi-stage/generate-week-content`
      - Generates 3-5 post ideas for each week
      - Each post includes type, topic, audience, call-to-action, persuasion principle, and visual ideas
      - Posts are designed to build on each other throughout the week

3. **User Feedback and Refinement**:
   - User can provide feedback on each week's content
   - Feedback can be used to regenerate specific weeks with refined instructions
   - Updates are applied immediately to the content outline display

4. **Storage Options**:
   - User can save the content outline to the `content_outlines` table
   - Content is also stored in localStorage for backup
   - Content outline is passed to the calendar generation process via URL parameters

### 3. Calendar Generation Process

The calendar generation process creates a scheduled content calendar from the content outline:

1. **Parameter Setup**:
   - User sets up calendar parameters including:
     - Start date
     - Posting frequency (light, moderate, heavy, intensive)
     - Posting days (Mon, Wed, Fri, etc.)
     - Posting time
     - Social media channels (Instagram, Facebook, etc.)

2. **AI-Powered Distribution**:
   - Content from the outline is sent to `/api/content/generate-calendar` along with parameters
   - The API uses Gemini AI to:
     - Distribute posts across selected posting days
     - Spread content evenly across weeks
     - Alternate between selected social channels
     - Follow frequency parameters
     - Maintain thematic consistency

3. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Has retry mechanism (up to 3 attempts)
   - Increases AI temperature slightly in each retry for variation
   - Includes fallback content generation if API fails
   - Validates response format before proceeding

4. **Calendar Storage**:
   - Calendar is saved to the `calendars` table with:
     - Reference to the original strategy (`strategy_id`)
     - All posts stored in the `posts` JSONB array
     - Initializes tracking data (progress, posts_scheduled, posts_published)
     - Sets initial status to 'active'

5. **Viewing and Exporting**:
   - Calendar can be viewed in calendar or list format
   - Posts can be edited individually
   - Calendar can be exported to CSV
   - Changes can be saved back to database

Each of these processes leverages AI technology to automate complex marketing tasks while allowing user customization at each step. The workflow provides a streamlined path from strategy development to ready-to-implement content calendars with minimal manual effort.

## Relationships

- A user can have many strategies
- A strategy can have one content outline
- A strategy can have multiple content plans
- A content plan can be associated with one calendar
- A calendar can contain many posts (either in the `posts` JSONB field or as separate records in calendar_posts)

## Important Implementation Notes

1. The application currently uses both storage approaches for posts:
   - Embedded JSONB in the `posts` field of the `calendars` table
   - Separate records in the `calendar_posts` table

2. When saving calendar data, ensure you're using the correct field names that exist in the database schema
